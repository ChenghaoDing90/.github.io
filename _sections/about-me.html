<p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Nuclear Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I will graduate on Dec 2021. I also hold a Master's degree in Applied Statistics from UIUC.</p>

<p>I am interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and so on. I have 3 years of experience in quantitative analytics and modeling, data science and machine learning. I am proficient in multiple programming languages.</p>

<p>My research projects focus on the interdisciplinary area between Climate Change and Data Science. I apply a series of statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and time series analysis to predict global warming, more specifically, on human-induced global warming.</p>

I am now actively seeking a summer internship opportunity as a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or quantitative analyst.
